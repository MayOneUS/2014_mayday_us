### Signup for MAYDAY Voterlogix 

Thanks for helping get out the vote in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District (NH-01), by supporting reform candidate Carol Shea-Porter. This MAYDAY Voterlogix tool will find and help you reach out to your Facebook friends who live in NH-01. The tool is in beta, so we don’t expect it to be perfect – the important thing is that we get the word out to NH voters in these crucial days leading up to the election. <strong>You’ll be able to control exactly how you message your friends</strong>, this tool just helps you identify them. 

Here’s how it works:

 1. Click “I Support with Facebook” and be sure to use the approval code <strong>mayday2840</strong>. 
 2. Voterlogix will connect with your Facebook and send you an email within an hour with how many friends you have in NH-01. 
 3. Go to your email account that’s linked to your Facebook and open the email, then follow the instructions provided. Use the pre-drafted message or write your own to reach out to your friends. 

Let’s elect Carol Shea-Porter for NH-01!
