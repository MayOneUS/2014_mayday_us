We are releasing [our raw data for May 1st to July 15th](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IZlJSRgmFl0b560c-uGv0hp6hdykNykFngQ5o7uXLDI/pubhtml) for all you democracy data-miners out there. 

Now, this is different from [the official FEC report](http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00562587/939397/#DETAILED) in two key ways. 

First, this raw data report has *no names* - just amounts, targeting, and occupation/employer data. This isn't because we're hiding anything or keeping donations anonymous. It's simply that our lawyers haven't taken a look at this data yet, and to play it safe, we're not including names or other identifying information, lest we inadvertently violate someone's privacy. Again - *names and addresses will be available on publically available FEC reports, as required by law*. But those reports take a lot of (billable) time to produce.     

Second, our lawyers and accountants have not yet gone over the data with a fine tooth comb to weed out any donations from people who failed to provide correct information - who, for example, listed their employer as "none of your business" or their name as "Mickey Mouse." This is why we haven't sent this info to the FEC yet - we may have to refund that money if we can't get the required information. 

From the data that we do know about, here's some preliminary results: 

Between May 1st and July 15th, there were 57120 total donors who used the website to make a pledge or donation, totaling $4,650,199.42. (This does not include donations received through Democracy.com or mailed checks.) 

Of those 57120 donors, there were 4070 people (7.13%) for whom we don't have any targeting data. These donations occurred from May 2nd-May 3rd, when we had our server hiccup because the site was flooded. (Other information was saved correctly.)

For the people we do have targeting data for, a whopping 71.43% of them chose "Whatever Helps."  That's astounding, and tells us that the vast, vast majority of our donors see this as a non-partisan issue. 

"Democrats Only" was chosen by 27.90% of donors, who donated 22.37% of the dollar amount.  "Republicans Only" was chosen by 0.68% of donors, who donated 0.64% of the dollar amount.

By far, most people donated $200 or less, making up 93% of our donor base, and over half of our total cash.  I wouldn't say that's unheard of, but it's got to be up there. In contrast, those donors who gave over $1000 (164 individuals who donated a collective $800,238.90) only gave us 17.21% of our total.  

|           | Donors    | $$ Cash         | % #       | % $    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Total     | 57120     | $4,650,199.42   |           |        |
| < $200    | 53124     | $2,350,063.81   | 93.00%    | 50.54% |
| $200-1000 | 3807      | $1,500,096.70   | 6.66%     | 32.26% |
| > $1000   | 164       | $800,238.90     | 0.29%     | 17.21% |

So even if we become like "every other political thing" and get bought by our biggest funder, our biggest funder turns out to be the people who give small dollar donations.  Not to belittle the contributions of those who wrote bigger checks, but it's nice to know that the only people we have to keep happy are the people who believe in our cause.
