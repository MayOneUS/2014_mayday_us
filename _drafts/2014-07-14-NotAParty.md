Reforming the role money plays in politics is something that over 90% of America agrees on. And the reason for that is that the corruption that comes from Congress’s continuous fundraising has blocked *everybody.* 

We’ve been *conspicuously* non-partisan for a number of reasons. The first among them: corruption is a non-partisan issue. It hurts everyone more or less equally, whether you’re on the left, right, or center of American politics. Furthermore, the politicians who (perhaps unwillingly or unknowingly) got us into this mess come from both sides of the aisle. 

But most importantly, the minute we become partisan, we make an enemy of a potential ally. If we were to support only Democrats, even those Republicans who agreed with us on the issue of corruption wouldn’t support us because of the company we keep. Ditto if we supported only Republicans. If the movement to reform the way we fund elections becomes a partisan issue, there is no chance of reform becoming law. 

### But what if your preferred party’s candidate doesn’t support reform? 

Well, let me address the Democrats first. 

If you look at what Democrats *want* - the policies they hope to enact, the future they would like to craft, they simply cannot get it until we get rid of the system of corruption. The dependence upon big-dollar fundraising, and the favors done in return, have been more of an obstruction to progressive goals than the Republican party even at 
it’s most intractable and stubborn. 

In short, in a race between a pro-Reform Republican and a status-quo Democrat, democratic voters will be *more likely to see progress by voting for the pro-Reform Republican,* no matter how reactionary his or her other priorities are. 
Now let me talk to the Republicans: 

As much as you may decry your local Democrat as a “big government spender,” you cannot hope to shrink the size of government until you end the system of corruption that encourages massive waste, crony capitalism, and corporate kickbacks through complex, burdensome loopholes. 

### The point is this: If you are casting your vote based on any issue *other* than reforming campaign fundraising, you are just *wasting your time.* 

Which brings us to what we’re doing about it. When we choose our five candidates to independently support, we will choose those candidates and those races we believe will best advance the cause of ending the system of corruption, party be damned. 

Now, there is some truth that the anti-corruption movement swells with progressives and Democrats far more than it does with conservatives and Republicans. 

In our own data, for every person that earmarked their donation "Republicans Only" there were fourty who earmarked their donation "Democrats Only." But keep in mind: our word-of-mouth campaign was almost entirely via email, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and blogs. All of these media skew younger - as does Democratic party identification. When Professor Lessig was invited to speak on TV, it was MSNBC, not Fox News, that invited him. And of course, our big tweet on the last day came from George Takei, who is equally known for being a gay-equality activist as he is for being helmsman of the Enterprise. 

But that doesn't explain the behavior of Republican federal office holders. When you look at Reform.to, pro-Reform Democrats vastly outnumber pro-reform Republicans. In fact, there are only two pro-Reform Republicans we know of at the federal level - Thomas Petri (R-WI) and Walter Jones (R-NC), who have committed to any sort of reform, versus about 200 Democrats. 

But *rank and file Republicans* are not the same as federally elected Republicans. And we know that Republican *voters* care deeply about corruption even if this issue isn't seen as a priority by conservative campaigns. 

That's part of the reason we have to use 2014 to *make* reforming this broken fundraising system an issue. We believe that we can start a snowball effect. And if we can reach enough conservative legislators by convincing them that anti-corruption legislation is the best thing they can do for the conservative cause - or at least by putting "the Mayday PAC might come for you" fear in them - then we can get statutory reform passed without having the full support of either party but the majority support of all of Congress. 

### Churchhill said, quite famously, that he would give a favorable mention to the Devil if Hitler invaded hell - the same principle applies. 

The Left and the Right have a bigger evil to fight - and like Churchhill and Stalin, will return to fighting each other when we have defeated the bigger evil in our midst. But until then, counter-intuitive as it may be, we must put aside our partisan flags and unite under a single banner with those who were once and will be in the future, our political rivals.
