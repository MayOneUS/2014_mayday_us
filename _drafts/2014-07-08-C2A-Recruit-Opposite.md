**If you're reading this and want to get involved beyond just contributing money, here's a Call to Action that you can do right now!**

Right now, I'd like each of you to go, *in person* or *on the phone,* by talking to a real person, just convince *one person* of the opposite political persuasion to at least hear you out on why we need reform, and why it blocks what they want as well as what you want. If you're a Republican, call or visit a Democrat - if you're a Democrat, call or visit a Republican. They can be friends, family, co-workers, or random strangers. Bonus points for actually going to a meeting of the *opposite* local county political party. 

Discuss this Call To Action on [reddit.com/maydaypac](http://reddit.com/maydaypac).

### Well, it was bound to happen eventually. 

We face two obstacles on our road to reform. The first, and by far the biggest, cynicism. The second, ignorance. 

But until recently, we were never the target of a *deliberate disinformation campaign.* 

As part of my job, I get Google alerts whenever someone in the news media (or in this case "news media") mentions "Mayday PAC." That's how I came across an article by the "Washington Free Beacon," entitled: "[Dark Money Behind Campaign Finance Push.](http://freebeacon.com/politics/dark-money-behind-campaign-finance-reform-push/)" 

The headline alone gave me a double take, but what threw me for a loop was the subheader.

> Reformers see campaign finance regulations as means to thwart political opposition. 

The article, calling Lessig a "liberal campaign finance reformer with ties to one of the left's leading dark money outfits..."

This is genius, of course. The article gets to name this nebulous tie to dark money outfits... without naming the dark money outfit or the exact nature of the tie. If they did, one could presumably verify the outfit, the relationship, the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the charge. 

You know. *Journalism.*

### When someone accuses you of being in a conspiracy with a mysterious organization, you can't prove that you're not in a conspiracy or that the organization doesn't exist, because if the organization did exist, and the conspiracy was there, that's exactly what we *would* say, wouldn't it?

In this case, I have no "free-con" clue what the "free-beacon" is talking about with "ties to dark money outfits." I wish they would have e-mailed, or called us for a response, to verify the story. 

You know. *Journalism.* 

Oh my god. What if we do have ties to dark money and *even we don't even know!* It's so dark even we can't see it! Aaaaah!

See, this is not just a smear job, it's an *incompetent* smear job. A *pro* would have called us and gotten us to say something that they could quote out of context; because "that was taken out of context" sounds like a lame excuse, even if it is true! 

If you read further down the article, there is a laughable, Rube Goldberg-esque attempt to tie us to a "shadowy dark money" outfit. See, Lessig advises the (non-partisan) Fund for the Republic. Fund for the Republic is tied to (the non-partisan) United Republic. United Republic acquired the group Lessig formed, the (non-partisan) Rootstrikers. Fund for the Republic hired a number of Republicans to it's board (because it's non-partisan) but "hiring Republicans" was *also*, supposedly a strategy that happened to be used (partisan) Democracy Alliance network. 

[!conspiracy](http://i.imgur.com/DhhTztW.jpg)

Having been slaving my brains out over Excel Spreadsheets, trying to get our first round, second round, checks, paypal, bitcoin, etc., all counted and correct before we file our report with the FEC and release vital stats to the Republic, I can tell you:

1. We have received no funds from the Democracy Alliance Network. 
2. We have received no funds from Fund for the Republic.
3. We have received no funds from United Republic.
4. We have received no funds from Rootstrikers.

So, there's a profound lack of money involved in this "tie to dark money."" 

Anyway, just about every other sentence in the article is false. Like this one:

> While Lawrence Lessig and others work to present the effort of his group, Mayday PAC, as bipartisan and politically neutral, Lessig’s most recent efforts as well as his past work with leading liberal activists and financiers suggest a more esoteric agenda.

es·o·ter·ic (ˌesəˈterik). Adj. 

1. intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest.

I love this, because only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest would actually know what esoteric means... but doesn't it just sound like a word that gives you the willies if you don't think about it too hard? 

> Lessig pitched wealthy donors in the tech community last week on the utility of restricting corporate political speech, saying their political agenda would be much easier to advance if opposing forces were restricted from influencing the political process.

There are so many things wrong with this sentence. (sigh). "The utility of restricting corporate political speech" is wrong - no model legislation over at reform.to would restrict corporate political speech - or any political speech - in any form. Volunteers even put turned the reforms into a *cartoon*, so there's no excuse for not understanding the concept. 

"their political agenda would be much easier to advance if opposing forces were restricted from influencing the political process."

Again - this isn't about restricting anyone's speech. It's just about providing a *viable alternative* for candidates to raise money than the current system of begging only from the large-dollar donors who often want favors in exchange for their patronage. 

Though, to be fair, "their political agenda would be easier to advance" is true. Because with real reform, *everyone's* political agenda would be easier to advance! Everyone, on the left, right, center, whether you consider yourself conservative, liberal, progressive, libertarian, whether you're one of the 1% or the 99%, or you think that the President is secretly controlled by alien lizardmen... or you're an alien lizardman trying to control the President... it doesn't matter. 

*All* political agendas right now are blocked because Congress is spending 30-70% of their time fundraising. They don't even have *time* to pursue sinister agendas! Or as Kevin Spacey put it, the Congress in "House of Cards," despite being a wretched hive of scum and villainy, *actually gets stuff done.* That's how bad things have gotten - sociopathy and conniving would be considered an *improvement.* 

### This is where it gets good...

So, having said all that, I was wondering, who exactly *is* this "Washington Free Beacon" anyway? 

Well, as it turns out, the Washington Free Beacon has a reputation for being... less than accurate. 

[From The Atlantic:](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/the-most-self-discrediting-partisan-attack-of-2012/255781/)

> But this isn't just embarrassing for the people who wrote and published it because it's despicable -- it's extra embarrassing because they've compromised their character for such inconsequential, poorly executed hackery. 

That was in regards to a story which implied that an Obama staffer spoke for the Administration (she did not), that her tweeting about Romney's poor polling with women were a coordinated attack by the Obama administration, (it was not), and that the same staffer following Mike Tyson's twitter feed was tantamount to endorsing Tyson's behavior (this is getting ridiculous) and that therefore, the Obama administration was endorsing Tyson's behavior (there is only so much stupid the brain can take before it shuts down.)

But what's interesing is that [the Free Beacon is, by it's own admission, funded by the Center for American Freedom, a 501(c)(4)](http://freebeacon.com/about/) -- a self-proclaimed conservative advocacy group. 

And guess what!

The Center for American Freedom [doesn't disclose its donors.](http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=31ADA019-4DAA-4765-9C2F-C7F74FD02CB2)

**That's right. The people implying we're secretly funded by a partisan dark-money SuperPAC... are secretly funded by a partisan dark-money SuperPAC.** 

[!The Evilest Thing](http://i.imgur.com/s2zg1qc.jpg)

### Which brings me to this Call To Action:

As stupid as this article was - and it was a doozy - the problem is that there are some who will read it, never having heard of the Mayday PAC, Lessig, or anything else and come to the conclusion that we're all *evil, evil people* trying to do *evil things.* Possibly involving goats and chanting. 

And having gone over the numbers, there is a really real fear that we do seem to be over-represented by Democrats than by Republicans. I think that's just a matter of demographics - we're primarily an Internet-based organization, and that skews younger - but if this is truly going to be a cross-partisan movement, it can't just be us up here at the top who "acts conspicuously non-partisan" by *diabolically* inviting conservatives to join in the organization. 

We need to do this from the grassroots as well. And that's what I want you to do. If you want to get involved, what you can do right now is convince someone who holds the *opposite* political view that you do that campaign finance reform is the First Issue. Democrats, go to Republicans. Republicans, go to Democrats. Libertarians, go to... I don't know, what's at the other corner of that weird diamond shaped diagram you pass around? 

[!xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nolan_chart.png)

Go to them. Get them to see how this blocks them as much as they block you. 

And if you want, tell the story in the Mayday PAC Subreddit at "[maydaypac.reddit.com](http://reddit.com/maydaypac)" - and learn from each other's victories and failures.
