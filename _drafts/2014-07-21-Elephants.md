We gave donors a choice of where they would like to target their donation. We did this mostly to assuage the fear that we were a partisan front - if that was a legitimate concern, you could tell us that your money would go to independently support one party or the other exclusively - so we wouldn't turn around and take the money you wanted to go to Democrats and spend it on Republicans - which was actually one concern posted on a [diary at the Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/07/10/1313026/-The-Color-of-Money-Are-Mayday-PAC-s-Online-Donors-Red-Purple-or-Blue), or vice-versa, which was a concern expressed by [Ellen Boyko, before I convinced her to send in $125. (Thanks Mom!)](http://www.boykotx.org/meet-brians-family/)

But because we did this, the data tells an alarming story. The vast majority of donors - around 70% have put in "Whatever helps" - and don't care about the political party, so long as it goes to fight systemic corruption. That's great.  But of the donors who did make a selection, the "Democrats Only" outnumbered the "Republicans Only" by a factor of 50 to 1.  

Right now, there are some partisan Democrats out there who are saying: "See! This is a partisan issue, the Republicans don't care about corruption at all!", while Republican pundits may be saying: "See, this is a partisan issue! MAYDAY's just another front for Democrats!" 

**No.**

First, let us not overlook the fact that non-partisans outnumbered partisans by a factor of 2-to-1. If anything, that tells us we need to be *more* mindful and fair to put the money where it will do the most good, regardless of party.  

But let's talk about this gap.  Let's think for a second about where we were able to get promotion. [When we were talked about in the mainstream media](https://mayday.us/media/), it was usually from those publications that tended to lean left - articles in the Atlantic and Mother Jones, blog mentions from the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/09/_n_5295544.html), [Truthout](http://truth-out.org/news/item/24971-crowdsourcing-our-way-out-of-the-crisis-of-democracy), and [BoingBoing.net](http://boingboing.net/2014/05/01/mayday-larry-lessig-launches.html) - and technology publications like Wired, the Webbys, Vox, Motherboard, etc. Our biggest final push was from [George Takei](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/george-takei-sets-phasers-to-reform.html). And while Takei's social media reach includes, well, everyone, there's no doubt that Takei's championship of equality for gay people around the world doesn't sit well with evangelicals and moral conservatives. We did get some television coverage, but mostly from MSNBC, not Fox News.  

We would have loved to appear on Fox News or conservative talk radio - we were just never invited.  

So if more Democrats than Republicans *heard* about MAYDAY PAC in the first place, of course our data will skew leftward. 

Secondly, we decided to do the fundraising and promotion via the Internet, because it was the most cost-effective way to handle the large volume of individual small-dollar contributions.  Younger generations tend to use the Internet more readily, more often, use it for communication and news - and younger generations skew progressive right now.  

Anyway, the point is that because of the way we were promoted, the way we collected information, we got biased results. For that reason, you should not take our raw numbers as evidence that campaign finance reform is solely a partisan Democratic issue.  Remember, 70% of people put down "Whatever helps."  That is the *opposite* of a partisan mandate. That's a mandate to continue to be non-partisan.  

But at the same time, we cannot ignore that most of the *current* leaders of the campaign finance reform movement in Washington are Democrats.  

It wasn't always this way. [Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) speech in New Hampshire in 1999 remains one of the best and earliest warnings of how Washington was broken. In fact, it was he who coined the term "System of Corruption."](http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/71643478112/john-mccains-great-bedford-nh-speech-1999) But John McCain has, for a while now, decided to focus on other causes to champion, and is no longer the de-facto leader of the Republican party, the way that he once was. Instead, Republican party leadership has fallen to people like [Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who has actively said that current campaign finance laws should be scrapped in order to outlaw unlimited *direct* donations to campaigns (rather than using the SuperPAC loophole.)](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80441.html) (To Cruz's credit, he is in favor of faster disclosure.)

Instead, politicians making this their key issue are people like Sen. Elisabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep John Sarbanes (D-MD). Indeed, Sarbanes has written the reform bill currently most popular in Congress, teh Grassroots Democracy Act. Of the 200 co-sponsors, however, only one of them, Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) is a Republican. 

There is the Republican-proposed Citizen Involvement in Campaigns Act, but other than the sponsor, Rep. Tom Petri (R-WI), no elected representative has signed on.  

That said, there's nothing that makes this a "progressive" issue at all. Corruption hurts everyone. 

There's no reason that Republicans *couldn't* lead on this issue if they chose to, and indeed, there are many Republicans in the rank-and-file grassroots attacking "crony capitalism." For many of them, it is the reason they got politically involved in the Tea Party.  And there are amazing elected Republicans at the state-level who are working to fix this issue by supporting Article V conventions in their state. But the Republican *federal* leadership has been lagging behind their own base in that regard.  

It would be stupid not to recognize that of the allies of reform at the *federal* level, most of them are Democrats. But it is also stupid to think that only Democrats want reform, only Democrats support reform, or only Democrats would benefit from reform.
