A month ago, Rep. Fred Upton might have thought he was cruising to another landslide re-election, and then everything changed.

On Wednesday morning, a new [internal poll](http://clementsforcongress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4178-MI-CD6-Memo-1.pdf) from challenger Paul Clements shows Upton's lead has been narrowed to just 4 points. And Wednesday afternoon, the Cook Political Report, one of the most respected political handicappers in the nation, [downgraded](http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings) Upton's chances from "solid" to "likely."

**To be sure, Upton has reason to be concerned. On October 9th, MAYDAY.US, a Super PAC fighting to fundamentally reform the way campaigns are funded, announced it would spend $1.5 million to defeat Upton and elect reformer Paul Clements. MAYDAY has since announced its commitment to spend [$2.15 million](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2014/10/mayday_pac_pours_additional_65.html) in this race.**

Paul Clements is running the most competitive race against Upton in a decade in a district President Obama won by 8 points in 2008 and narrowly lost in 2012, when Upton won reelection by the [smallest margin](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/11/congressman_fred_upton_wins_ka.html) of his career.

When it comes to Fred Upton, the link between the people who fund his campaigns and the way he votes in Congress is crystal clear.

Upton has taken $10 million in special interest PAC money over his career. He took $2.1 million from Big Oil and energy interests, and he voted to give away billions in subsidies for oil and gas companies. He took $1.4 million from drug and insurance companies, and voted to make seniors pay more for the prescriptions they need.

**Once MAYDAY started its campaign to inform voters in Southwest Michigan, Fred Upton's campaign went into panic mode.** Upton:

- Lobbed inaccurate attacks against MAYDAY

- Hastily threw together a response ad

- Abruptly cancelled his only scheduled debate with Clements

- Dramatically escalated his campaign spending

- Possibly violated House ethics rules by reaching out to MAYDAY donors


In the last week of the campaign, Upton has bought approximately 4,000 gross ratings points in the Grand Rapids market alone â€“ and half of those ads are in direct response to MAYDAY's campaign.

In the midst of the Upton campaign's scramble, a series of unforced errors by the congressman and his staff have started a simmering scandal that threatens to boil over in the closing days of this campaign. On October 17th, Upton told the [Kalamazoo Gazette](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2014/10/mayday_pac_ad_funders_against.html) he had talked to several of MAYDAY's major donors about our campaign against him. Three days later, the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/20/mayday-pac-upton_n_6016028.html) reported Gary Andres, Upton's top committee aide, had reached out to "spook" MAYDAY donors whose businesses are regulated by the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee that Upton chairs.

Since then, the Upton camp's story has, shall we say, evolved. After admitting that he spoke with several donors, Upton's campaign first called the allegations " [hogwash](http://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/tough-talk/article_84863374-59ea-11e4-b136-afdf0ee1268c.html)," then said Upton spoke to only one MAYDAY donor, who happened to call Upton. Following the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/20/mayday-pac-upton_n_6016028.html) report, Andres first denied "making angry calls," but later told the [Herald-Palladium](http://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/upton-aide-shocked-by-huffpo-piece/article_cde77e0b-45c9-5f7c-9665-17f6456ce303.html) he sent messages to a MAYDAY donor through the donor's lobbyist in Washington.

This Upton saga is straight out of the pages of Peter Schweizer's book Extortion, and serves as a perfect example of how politicians legally extort money from big corporations for personal and political benefit. It may also contribute to Upton's undoing. I've recently written to the House Office of Congressional Ethics [requesting an investigation](http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/10/27/6235678/pac-founder-seeks-probe-of-gop.html) into the reports that Upton and his staff tried to intimidate MAYDAY's donors and the [American Democracy Legal Fund](http://americandemocracy.org/request-for-investigation-into-conduct-of-rep-fred-upton-r-mi/) has filed a similar request.

MAYDAY decided to work to defeat Fred Upton because he is the epitome of the modern corrupt politician and because we believed voters in the 6th Congressional District of Michigan care enough about taking big money out of politics to support a reformer like Paul Clements. Our own polling has shown significant movement in Upton's job performance and favorability ratings since our campaign began.

As we enter the final days of this campaign, it looks like MAYDAY's work and Upton's unforced errors may results in a surprising result on Election Day.
