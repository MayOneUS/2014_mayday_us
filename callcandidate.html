# Contact a candidate
{:.no_toc}

MAYDAY has officially begun announcing which candidates we are backing for November 2014. This is the beginning of the end for those candidates who have not made clear that they support fundamental reform and an end to moneyed corruption. 

We want you to help us get the word out to candidates: back reform legislation and inoculate yourself from the Mayday PAC. Otherwise, continue at your own risk.

### We want you to call or email your Representative and Senators, (or challengers to their positions), and help us keep track of who has been called, and how often, using the form below.

This can be done in four easy steps:

1. Go to [http://www.reform.to](http://www.reform.to)
2. Type in your address or zip to search for your representative or candidate.
3. Do they support reform? If YES, send them a thank you! If NO, send them an email, call them, or show up and demand an answer.
4. Tell us who you contacted below so we can keep track of responses.

**Deadline:** Candidates have until 5 PM EST next Tuesday, August 5, to inoculate themselves. That means we have one week to urge candidates to do the right thing.

Sample call and e-mail scripts are provided below:

### Letter of Encouragement

Dear Representative/ Senator _____,

I am your constituent and a proud supporter of the Mayday PAC. We want a Congress that will fundamentally change the way elections are funded, and through that change, reduce the stranglehold of big money in our politics. 

There are currently several proposals for legislation that would reduce the corrupting inﬂuence of money in politics, listed at reform.to. I am disappointed that I cannot ﬁnd you on the record supporting any of them. You are in a position to champion the values on which this Republic was founded. I urge you to consider that opportunity and examine your role in the ﬁght for reform. Please visit reform.to and use the “take the pledge” tool to let the people know where you stand.

Best Regards,

________________
