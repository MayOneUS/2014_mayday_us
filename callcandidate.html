### Letter of Encouragement

Dear Representative/ Senator _____________,

I am your constituent and a proud supporter of the Mayday PAC. We are working to make Campaign Finance Reform a key issue in upcoming elections. There are currently several proposals for legislation that would reform the corrupting inﬂuence of money in politics. I am disappointed that I can not ﬁnd you on the record supporting any of them. You are in a position to champion the values on which this Republic was founded. I urge you to consider that opportunity and examine your role in the ﬁght for reform. Please visit reform.to and use the "take the pledge" tool to let the people know where you stand. 

Best Regards,

________________
