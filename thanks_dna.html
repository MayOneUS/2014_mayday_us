Thank you! Don't worry, we know how annoying those e-mails asking for money can be and we won't send you any more of them. 

We'll just keep you updated with news and events as the campaign continues towards election day.  

We're eager to see how this experiment works - and if you like it, feel free to [Share on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/home?status=%23MaydayPAC%20just%20asked%20me%20if%20I%20wanted%20to%20opt-out%20of%20fundraising%20emails.%20(Wish%20more%20political%20groups%20would%20do%20that.)

If you want, you can [head here to make one last contribution](/newpledge), or come back to our website and find any of the big red Donate buttons. (We know, it's a bit tacky, but it does help, honest.)
