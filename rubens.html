{% endcapture %}

{% capture oppblurb %}

Scott Brown once supported public financing of elections and foreswore Super PAC dollars in his 2012 campaign against Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  But today, [his campaign is backed by special interest money](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/03/scott-brown-new-hampshire-senate-jeanne-shaheen). [Brown cast a crucial vote to stop the DISCLOSE act](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/how-did-senators-vote-on-the-disclose-act/2012/07/16/gJQALt4ppW_blog.html), which would have increased donor transparency in response to the Citizens United ruling.
