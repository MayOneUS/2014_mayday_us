# Fact Sheet on 2014 Races

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Staci Appel, IA-3 House general election:

Democrat Staci Appel is running against David Young, a former aide to Sen. Chuck Grassley. Currently represented by a retiring Republican, President Obama won this district in 2012.

__FACTS:__  Staci Appel has [pledged to support](http://www.scribd.com/doc/235323586/Appel-Questionnaire-Democracy) a constitutional amendment to overturn the disastrous Citizens United ruling. She supports the Government By The People Act (public matching funds) – and, as State Senator, Appel sponsored legislation ([SSB 1173](https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=dspldata&var=sbco&CFID=13&GA=82)) that would have established public financing of elections in Iowa for the first time.

__FACTS:__ Young is funded by big-money special interests based in Washington, DC.  The top contributing “industry” to Young’s campaign is [lobbyists, who have contributed $77,500](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/indus.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), more donors from DC have given to his campaign [than any other metropolitan area](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/geog.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), and he has more donors from out of state than from Iowa.

### Mayday PAC supports Republican Walter Jones, NC-3 House general election:###

Republican Congressman Walter Jones prevailed over his most competitive challenge to date in the NC-3 Republican primary — his opponent was largely funded by outside money. He is now running against Marshall Adame, a retired Marine and former U.S. diplomat, in the general election. Jones has represented the third district for 10 terms.

__FACTS:__ Congressman Walter Jones is the [only Republican](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/walter-jones-taylor-griffin_n_5187262.html) House member who vocally supports changing the way elections are funded. He [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) [Citizens United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) "one of the worst decisions by the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime." Jones is proof that campaign finance reform is an issue that gains [traction on both sides of the aisle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw).

__FACTS:__ Congressman Jones is an original co-sponsor of the [Government By the People Act](http://www.publicampaign.org/blog/2014/02/21/republican-walter-jones-supports-government-people-act). Jones’ history of sponsoring legislation to get money out of politics includes the [Fair Elections Now Act](http://action.fairelectionsnow.org/fairelections) from 2008, which was reintroduced in the House in 2011. In 2013, he introduced H.R. 3466 or [No Political Funds for Personal Use](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3466), a bill that would close the personal use loophole for all [political committees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/republican-campaign-finance-reform_n_4324754.html).

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Carol Shea-Porter, NH-1 House general election:###

Democrat Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter is running against Frank Guinta, the former incumbent who lost to Shea-Porter in 2012. The race has been rated as a "toss-up" by most major news organizations.

*__FACTS:__* Congresswoman Shea-Porter co-sponsored the [Government By the People Act](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Carol_Shea-Porter_Government_Reform.htm). In addition, campaign finance reform is a cornerstone of her [re-election campaign](http://www.sheaporter.com/Issues/2012-08-campaign-finance-reform). Shea-Porter is a co-sponsor of the [Fair Elections Now Act](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/269/cosponsors) and participated in the ["New Hampshire Rebellion"](http://blog.ted.com/2014/01/24/larry-lessig-completes-185-mile-walk-across-new-hampshire/) protest in 2014.

__FACTS:__ Guinta was named one of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s [Most Corrupt](http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/frank-guinta) members of congress during his first term. He was [placed under federal investigation](http://www.citizensforethics.org/page/-/PDFs/Reports/Most Corrupt Reports/Guinta, Frank.pdf?nocdn=1) for irregularities in his 2010 campaign finances. In 2012, Guinta’s top donors included [Citizens United and Koch Industries](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&cid=N00030801).

### Mayday PAC supported Democrat Reuben Gallego, AZ-7 primary election: Gallego won the primary!

By voting for Gallego on August 26, voters in Arizona’s 7th Congressional district brought us one step closer to diminishing the influence of money in politics and bringing our system back to a true democracy.

Democrat Reuben Gallego is a former Arizona state representative running against Mary Rose Wilcox, the Maricopa County Supervisor. The district is currently represented by retiring democratic congressman Ed Pastor.

__FACTS:__ Gallego believes that the only way to get Washington working again is to take money out of politics. [He supports](http://gallegoforarizona.com/money-in-politics/) the Government by the People Act and a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Citizens United decision.

__FACTS:__ Gallego has received several high profile endorsements, including current Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz) who has received praise from the [Fair Elections Now Coalition](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fair-elections-now-coalition-praises-rep-raul-grijalva-for-cosponsoring-fair-elections-now-act-60778672.html) for co-sponsoring the Fair Elections Now Act. Grijalva endorsed Gallego in a [written statement](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/raul-grijalva-arizona-2014-primary-104818.html#ixzz39ofR6WmW), saying "I worked with Ed Pastor for many years. He was the best partner I could have asked for in Phoenix, and I couldn’t think of a better candidate to replace him than Ruben Gallego."


### Mayday PAC supported Republican Jim Rubens, NH U.S. Senate primary: Rubens lost the primary.

Although Rubens didn't win on September 9, he gained significant ground in a short period. In a July Global Strategy Group poll, Rubens earned 9% of the Republican primary vote and was familiar to just 36% of likely primary voters. Rubens ended the race with 23.5% of the vote and familiar to 58% of Republican primary voters.

From our polling after the election, we found that our issue had critical resonance with an important segment of New Hampshire Republicans. 37% said that “reducing the corrupting influence of politics was a major or deciding factor in their vote for Senate.” And among that 37%, our candidate beat the Republican nominee by 18 points!

Scott Brown and Jim Rubens were the two leading candidates in the crowded field for the GOP nomination to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen.

__FACTS:__ Jim Rubens was campaigning on a 9-point [Political Reform Agenda](http://jimrubens.com/issues/agenda), including a plan to “enact a public elections financing system for candidates.” [He also pledged to support the Taxation without Representation Act](http://reform.to/#/candidates/S4NH00112), which would create a public financing system for elections to diminish the power of big money in politics. The act would provide taxpayers up to $200 apiece in vouchers that they can sign over only to candidates they support, empowering everyday citizens.

__FACTS:__  Scott Brown [refused to co-sponsor](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.2023.IS:/) the Fair Elections Now Act, the public financing bill in the U.S. Senate. He was the [deciding vote](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm%3Fcongress=111%26session=2%26vote=00240) against the DISCLOSE Act, a crucial bill to increase donor transparency after the *Citizens United* ruling. After [agreeing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brown-warren-pledge-to-curb-outside-campaign-spending/2012/01/23/gIQAi4jbLQ_story.html) to a “People’s Pledge” to combat special-interest money in the Massachusetts Senate race, he [refuses to](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/24/scott-brown-senate_n_5018641.html) this year. Brown’s campaign is fueled by [special-interest money](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/03/scott-brown-new-hampshire-senate-jeanne-shaheen), including millions from Wall Street and financial interests.
