### *Which Candidates Will Fight Back Against Big Money in Politics?*
{:.no_toc}

### Mayday PAC supports Republican Jim Rubens, NH U.S. Senate primary:   

Scott Brown and Jim Rubens are two leading candidates in the crowded field for the GOP nomination to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen. 

<strong>FACTS:</strong> Jim Rubens is campaigning on a 9-point [Political Reform Agenda](http://jimrubens.com/issues/agenda), including a plan to “enact a public elections financing system for candidates.” [He also has pledged to support the Taxation without Representation Act](http://reform.to/#/candidates/S4NH00112), which would create a public financing system for elections to diminish the power of big money in politics. The act would provide taxpayers up to $200 apiece in vouchers that they can sign over only to candidates they support, empowering everyday citizens. 

<strong>FACTS:</strong>  Scott Brown [refused to co-sponsor](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.2023.IS:/) the Fair Elections Now Act, the public financing bill in the U.S. Senate. He was the [deciding vote](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm%3Fcongress=111%26session=2%26vote=00240) against the DISCLOSE Act, a crucial bill to increase donor transparency after the *Citizens United* ruling. After [agreeing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brown-warren-pledge-to-curb-outside-campaign-spending/2012/01/23/gIQAi4jbLQ_story.html) to a “People’s Pledge” to combat special-interest money in the Massachusetts Senate race, he [refuses to](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/24/scott-brown-senate_n_5018641.html) this year. Brown’s campaign is fueled by [special-interest money](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/03/scott-brown-new-hampshire-senate-jeanne-shaheen), including millions from Wall Street and financial interests.

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Staci Appel, IA-3 House general election:

Democrat Staci Appel is running against David Young, a former aide to Sen. Chuck Grassley. Currently represented by a retiring Republican, President Obama won this district in 2012. 

<strong>FACTS:</strong>  Staci Appel has [pledged to support](http://www.scribd.com/doc/235323586/Appel-Questionnaire-Democracy) a constitutional amendment to overturn the disastrous Citizens United ruling. She supports the Government By The People Act (public matching funds) – and, as State Senator, Appel sponsored legislation ([SSB 1173](https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=dspldata&var=sbco&CFID=13&GA=82)) that would have established public financing of elections in Iowa for the first time. 

<strong>FACTS:</strong> Young is funded by big-money special interests based in Washington, DC.  The top contributing “industry” to Young’s campaign is [lobbyists, who have contributed $77,500](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/indus.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), more donors from DC have given to his campaign [than any other metropolitan area](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/geog.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), and he has more donors from out of state than from Iowa.
