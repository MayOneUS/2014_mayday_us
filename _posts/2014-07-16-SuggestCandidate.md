Yesterday, MAYDAY directors and advisers met to discuss district targets for our 2014 campaigns. Our goal is simple: to send a message that we intend to fundamentally change politics for good. But before we make our final decisions, we want to hear from you.

**[Tell us where we should target in 2014.](/suggest-a-candidate)**

Many of you have asked "what makes a MAYDAY race?" There are several core criteria for the kinds of races we want to target:

* We want a plausible path to victory where MAYDAY can make the difference.
* We want to target bad actors and support good ones.
* We want to use our resources where they will be cost-effective.
* We want our work to have a “ripple-effect,” proving that MAYDAY is a powerful threat to incumbency.

If you think you know a race that fits these criteria, [let us know where MAYDAY should go](/suggest-a-candidate) through this web form.

We know you're eager to hear more about what comes next. We're eager to get there, too. But our strength is this community, so before we make this critical decision, we want to make sure we've heard from you.

Thank you for all you've done, and all you do still.
