### Two more weeks of data

Today &ndash; in our commitment to transparency &ndash; we are releasing the second installment of our donation data. This new data file contains all donor data from the beginning of our campaign in May through Thursday, August 14, 2014.

As pointed out on August 5, 2014 by Tim Smith, there were [some issues](http://rpubs.com/tdsmith/maydaycleanup) with the initial data dump, including incorrect dates and zip codes. We have cleaned up some of the issues with dates in the previously released set and have also cleaned over 1500 address records where state and city were incorrect. Our dedicated data team is continuing to clean the data.

Finally, in this release, we are adding a table breaking down all of our donors by the targeting criteria of the donation. Supporters were given the option to check one of three boxes &ndash; Democrats Only, Republicans Only, or Whatever Helps &ndash; indicating their preference about whether their contribution should be used for candidates from a specific party only 71.4% of donors opted to have their funds go toward “Whatever Helps” reflecting the bipartisanship of this issue.

We are eager to honor our core value of transparency and our commitment to release an updated data file every two weeks. As we continue to clean our data and improve our release process, we welcome your feedback and interest.
