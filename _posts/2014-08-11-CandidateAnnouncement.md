# Campaign Will Now Target Eight Total Races, Including Three Candidates Announced Today. First Radio Ads to Air in New Hampshire.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Mayday PAC expands their number of targeted races from five to eight.Mayday PAC will increase its campaign spending due to better than expected fundraising and broad citizen support. The additional three targets will be announced once field teams and campaigners are in place.

In addition, today Mayday PAC announces three more of the eight total candidates it will support: Walter Jones (R, NC-3), Carol Shea-Porter (D, NH-1) and Ruben Gallego, Democratic candidate in Arizona’s seventh congressional district to replace retiring Congressman Ed Pastor.

With this announcement, Mayday PAC continues to meet its commitment to work with candidates who support reform on both sides of the aisle. Mayday PAC will be communicating directly with voters in these districts with specific messages on political cronyism and reform. With consulting help from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), Mayday PAC will be working to make campaign finance reform a fundamental issue in each of these races.

A fact sheet and additional information on each candidate’s record on reform can be found here. Today Mayday PAC also announces the placement of its first radio ads in New Hampshire, in support of Senate candidate Jim Rubens. These ads make it clear to voters that the only way to reclaim our democracy and get government working again is to reduce money in politics. These ads can be found here.

“Today we’re taking several big steps in Mayday’s plan to retake our Democracy. All eight of our candidates are leaders on reform and, when elected to Congress, they will help us reach our goal of constitutional amendment,” said Lawrence Lessig, Mayday PAC co-founder with Mark McKinnon, Republican strategists.

“For both Republicans and Democrats, reform is a winning issue. Our expansion to eight targets is both a testament to successful citizen-up fundraising and evidence of this movement’s broad support,” added McKinnon.
