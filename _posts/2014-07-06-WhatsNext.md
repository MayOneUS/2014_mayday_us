Ok, I slept. A lot. For the first time, forever.

### Overflowing my inbox is a single question: What’s next?

Next is selecting the candidates. We’ve been looking at this for months, but there is tons to think through before we make the choice.

Here’s the simplest *first step* — though there are many steps after this:

Q1: Is the candidate *credibly* on the right side of reform.to?

> If so, then it is not possible that they’ll be someone we’re trying to remove.

> If not, then it is not possible that they’ll be someone we’re trying to elect.

There’s little fudging in the “credibly” qualification: the commitment one way or the other has to be believable. But beyond that, this is a pretty good first step to understanding the universe of possible targets and support.

In other news, today begins some time away with my family. Can’t wait.
