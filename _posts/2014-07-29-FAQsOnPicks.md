There have been a number of questions that I'm sure our supporters are asking right now.  We've added them to the [FAQ page](/faq) but we'd like to also post them here for easy access. 

### Why are you supporting a Republican?

In the New Hampshire Republican Senate **Republican Primary**, we are supporting two-term State Senator Jim Rubens, the only Republican U.S. Senate candidate in the nation who has openly endorsed fundamental reform to the way campaigns are funded. 

Better yet, he's made political reform his central issue. While most Republicans in Congress oppose reform, this is a race where reformers can show that we will have the backs of those brave Republicans who buck special interests and do the right thing.

### By supporting Rubens, are you opposing incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D), a champion of reform?

The campaign we announced is in the Republican *Primary* in New Hampshire. In that race, we're supporting Jim Rubens *against Scott Brown.* 

If Jim Rubens wins the primary, then both candidates in the NH Senate race will be for public funding of elections. Our work will be done. We have no reason to be supporting one pro-public funding candidate against another. 

We will wait for the results of the primary before deciding whether to take further steps in the NH Senate race.  

### You're giving candidates a chance to inoculate themselves by pledging for reform. What happens if a candidate claims to support reform, and then doesn't?

Those candidates could be on our target list for 2016. 

### My candidate supports reform, but you don't have their stance listed!?

Great! [Send us a press release or public statement](/contact), and we'll make sure it gets posted.
