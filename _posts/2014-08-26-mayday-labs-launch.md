### Launch of Mayday Labs

In under four months, [MAYDAY.US](https://mayday.us) has broken new ground in online organizing around the issue of political corruption.  To build on this momentum, we are announcing the creation of Mayday Labs.

Mayday Labs is the open source, technical project arm of [MAYDAY.US](https://mayday.us).  Labs will work towards the following goals:

 - Cultivate participation by the technical community in the anti-corruption
movement
 - Enable movement supporters to connect, interact, engage and take action
 - Refine the messages of anti-corruption movement and increase their effectiveness
 - Incubate and facilitate technical innovation and ideas to help the anti-corruption
movement

Our technology will be an extension of the existing [Google AppEngine Python infrastructure](https://github.com/MayOneUS/wiki/wiki/Developer-Information) created by the Mayday First Responders.  We will coordinate the project via the [Mayday Labs Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mayday-labs) and the #maydaypac IRC channel on Freenode.

We invite developers, designers, technical project managers, growth hackers and organizers to join the project.  Please [join the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mayday-labs) or come into the IRC channel.

Over the coming months, we will identify 5-7 experienced volunteer core developers for Mayday Labs, establish project process and governance, and deliver functionality to help Mayday supporters organize around campaigns.

We look forward to creating a new way for hackers to contribute their skills to fixing corruption, and to inventing the next generation of open source software for movement building and collaboration.

We hope you'll join us.
