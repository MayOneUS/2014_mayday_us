### Launch of Mayday Labs

The Mayday organization has broken new ground in online organizing of activists around the issue of corruption.  To build on this momentum, we are announcing the creation of Mayday Labs.

Mayday Labs is an open source organization that will work towards the following goals:

 - Cultivate participation by the technical community in the campaign finance reform
movement
 - Enable movement supporters to connect, interact, engage and take action
 - Refine the messages of campaign finance reform and increase their effectiveness
 - Incubate and facilitate technical innovation and ideas to help the campaign finance reform
movement

The project will built on the existing [Google AppEngine Python infrastructure](https://github.com/MayOneUS/wiki/wiki/Developer-Information) created by the Mayday First Responders.  We will coordinate the project via the [Mayday Labs Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mayday-labs) and the #maydaypac IRC channel on Freenode.

We are inviting developers, designers, technical project managers, growth hackers and organizers to join the project.  Please join the googlegroup, or come into the IRC channel.

Over the coming months, we will identify 5-7 experienced volunteer core developers for Mayday Labs, establish project process and governance, and deliver functionality to help Mayday supporters organize around campaigns.

We also welcome experienced in project managerment and running open source projects to act as advisors for Mayday Labs.
