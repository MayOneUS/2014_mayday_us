### We did it.

Our first Mayday reform candidate, Ruben Gallego, declared victory last night in Arizona's 7th Congressional District. Last night's win shows that voters care about this issue, no matter what the pundits and people in Washington want to say.

Together, we are going to win our Democracy back. Will you help us spread the word?

By supporting Ruben Gallego, voters made it clear that they want to fundamentally change the way elections are funded. Our experiment is working. And last night’s victory will be the first of many.

When he wins in November, then we will be one anti-corruption representative closer to changing the way we fund elections.

Please [share this with your friends](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://mayday.us/2014/08/27/gallego-victory/) and ask them to join us in taking our Democracy back.

As you know, the spotlight was on for our first big race, and the last-minute phone calls and Tweets helped to drive people to the polls and push us over the top. This would not be possible without your support. Thank you.
