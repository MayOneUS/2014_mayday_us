### Two more weeks of data

Today, in our commitment to transparency, we are releasing the second installment of our donation data. This new data file contains all donor data from the beginning of our campaign in May through August 14, 2014. Click here to check out the [full data release](http://mayday.us/your-donations/).

As pointed out by Tim Smith in his post from August 5, 2014, there were [some issues](http://rpubs.com/tdsmith/maydaycleanup) with the initial data dump, including incorrect dates and zip codes. We cleaned up some of the issues in the previously released set and have also updated over 1,500 address records where state and city were incorrect. Our dedicated data team is continuing to clean the data.

Finally, in this release, we are adding a table breaking down all of our donors by the targeting criteria of the donation. Supporters were given the option to check one of three boxes &ndash; Democrats Only, Republicans Only, or Whatever Helps &ndash; indicating their preference about whether their contribution should be used for candidates from a specific party. 71.4% of donors opted to have their funds go toward “Whatever Helps” reflecting the bipartisanship of this issue.

We are eager to honor our core value of transparency and our commitment to release an updated data file every two weeks. As we continue to clean our data and improve our release process, we welcome your feedback and interest. Additionally, if you want to create interesting ways to visually display our data, please share them with us at info@mayday.us.
