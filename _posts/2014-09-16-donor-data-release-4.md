### Two more weeks of data

Itâ€™s that time again: our bi-weekly Mayday data release! Highlighted changes from Data Release #4:

* Total donors is now up to 61,151
* Total donated is now up to 7,909,571
* We fixed a bug in the parsing code that switched several hundred dates from "9/5/14" to "9/14/5" -- the dates are now listed correctly.
* We added several missing zip codes from our top donors.
* We included additional targeting data that hadn't been merged into our data dumps -- approximately $200,000 is now correctly shown in the break out on the data release page.

We want the highest-possible level of transparency with you, our supporters, and we would love to hear your feedback. We are also on the lookout for opportunities to demonstrate the corrupting influence of money in politics. If you would like to help, please get in touch at [info@mayday.us](mailto:info@mayday.us).

Thanks!
