MAYDAY is a crowdfunded, kickstarted Super PAC to end all Super PACs. We want to fight fire with fire, but we also want to bring a different kind of flame to the fight -- we won't win with money alone.

We need you to tell us: what campaign tools and tactics should we emphasize in this fight? And what shouldn't we?

Choose what you think is most important from the tactical options on the right. Then make a pledge, and we'll use your input in crafting our campaign to take back our democracy.  Remember, because it's kickstarted, we only keep your money if we reach our goal.
