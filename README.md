2014 Mayday PAC US Homepage
==================

### What's this?
This is the 2014 election site for [Mayday PAC](mayday.us).
We're currently running this repo at v1.mayday.us.

### How can I help?
Send over a PR *(topic branches please)*!
This site is build with Jekyll, so you'll need that on your computer to hack on the code.
To run it locally just run `jekyll serve --watch`, it'll update when you change the code

More info about what we're going to do to this on [the wiki](https://github.com/MayOneUS/wiki/wiki).

## New pages

If your adding a new page to the site, you might want to start with the example template at `_doc/example-page-template.html`
