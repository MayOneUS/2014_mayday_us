### Biography: 

Born and raised in Iowa, married for 18 years this fall, mother to six kids and a former Financial Consultant, Staci Appel calls rural Ackworth, Iowa home. Staci took her deep Iowa roots, and her equally deep commitment to Iowa families to the State Senate in 2006 where she fought for Iowa’s backbone – middle-class families, farmers and small-business owners. During Staci’s time in the Iowa Senate, legislators took notice of her steadfast commitment to the people she served. Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal said, “I have never seen a freshman legislator come down to the capital and work as hard as Staci Appel.”

That work included leadership on legislation like Iowa’s statewide smoking ban, pre-school for every 4 year old and championing the bill making Iowa the first state in the nation to require equal pay for equal work.

Democrat Staci Appel is running against David Young, a former aide to Sen. Grassley. Currently represented by a retiring Republican, President Obama won this district in 2012. 

# Why We Chose Staci Appel

Staci Appel has pledged to support a constitutional amendment to overturn the disastrous Citizens United ruling (source: Progressive Action PAC questionnaire).

As State Senator, Appel sponsored legislation ([SSB 1173](https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=dspldata&var=sbco&CFID=13&GA=82)) that would have established public financing of elections in Iowa for the first time.
