Lawrence Lessig: When Scott Brown ran for Senate in Massachusetts, he raised more than 7 million dollars from financial, insurance and real estate interests. He received more money from hedge funds and Wall Street than any other candidate in the nation.

Now truth be told, Scott Brown is not a bad guy.

And his numbers from special interests and cronies is pretty normal. Washington is filled with politicians who depend upon cronies to fund their campaigns.

But if you don’t like a government run by and for these cronies, then what exactly are you doing about it? Because unless you vote against crony capitalism, nothing is going to change.

There is only one Republican candidate for Senate in the nation who’s had the courage to stand up to big money in Washington and offer a plan to fix it: Jim Rubens.

Candidates like Jim Rubens need to win if the system is ever going to change.

So vote Jim Rubens on September 9.
