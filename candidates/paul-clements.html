Paul Clements is running to represent Michigan's 6th Congressional District, which is currently represented by incumbent Fred Upton, one of the worst of the worst when it comes to political corruption.

## Why We Chose Paul Clements

Paul Clements supports the boldest reform in Congress, the Government By The People Act, which would match small-dollar donations and decrease the influence of big-money donors.Fred Upton, on the other hand has taken in $10 million in PAC money and voted to protect special interests - and his own interests - over the interests of his district.

## District Overview

MAYDAY.US will spend more than $1 million to defeat Fred Upton and elect Paul Clements.

President Obama won Michigan’s Sixth District 53% to 45% in 2008 and narrowly lost 49% to 50% two years ago. In 2012, Upton won reelection by the ​[smallest margin](http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/11/congressman_fred_upton_wins_ka.html) of his career and Paul Clements ​is running the most competitive campaign against ​the entrenched incumbent in over a decade.
