### Victory must be plausible and MAYDAY must make the difference. 

Not only must victory be possible, but we must make sure that it was clear that our involvement, as well as the issue of corruption, was seen as the determining factor in victory. 

### We must replace ‘bad actors’ with ‘champions.’ 

Not only must we target those politicians who are clearly captured by special interests and stand against reform, we must also support candidates who will fight for a fundimental change in Congress and will champion the issue in the halls of power, in their home districts, and in the media.  

### We must use our resources where they will be cost-effective

While the amount of money we have raised is staggering, it is still a finite amount and must be used wisely. When it comes down to it, we want to be able to make the biggest impact with the smallest cost possible.  

### We must plan for the long-term strategy by hoping to have a “ripple-effect.”

In 2014, we cannot fight in every district - only five. Our ability to win the Congress dedicated to reform in 2016 is to make it clear to incumbents that our victory was not an outlier or due to special circumstances. Rather, they must see similarities in the districts and races we choose and their own.
